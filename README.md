# SocialGaming
University course on Game Networking (Teamwork 4 People)

The purpose of this project is to get an understanding of how social relationships and networking affects the Gaming.

In order to have measurable results we used Social Graphs and Clustering to improve our networking and user experience.

Our project is a Jump'n'Run game in which 2 players compete against each other.
- Player 1 plays the path
- Player 2 builds the path

Get rewarded for victories and be the best on the leaderboard. Social Relationships strenghten rewards and provide players exclusive features.

I contributed to the Artstyle of the Game, various UX Designs and the Authentication of Users.
